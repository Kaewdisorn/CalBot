API Package - Contains all API route definitions

This package organizes your API endpoints into logical groups.
The router.py file combines all routes into one router that main.py imports.

Structure:
- router.py       → Combines all route modules
- routes/         → Individual route files (health.py, schedule.py, etc.)
