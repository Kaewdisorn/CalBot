Models Package - Pydantic data models

Models define the shape of your data and provide automatic validation.
FastAPI uses these to:
- Validate incoming request data
- Serialize response data to JSON
- Generate API documentation

Files:
- schedule.py → Schedule models (Schedule, ScheduleCreate, ScheduleUpdate)

Example:
    from app.models.schedule import Schedule, ScheduleCreate
